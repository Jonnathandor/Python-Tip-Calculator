# Tip Calculator CLI Application

## Overview

This Tip Calculator is a simple command-line application that helps users calculate the amount of tip each person needs to pay when splitting a bill.

## Structure

The application is divided into two main parts:

- `tip_calculator.py`: Contains the business logic for calculating tips.
- `main.py`: Handles the command-line interface, taking user input and displaying the results.

## Usage

To run the application, navigate to the directory containing `main.py` and run:
`python main.py`

Follow the prompts to enter the total bill amount, the number of people splitting the bill, and the desired tip percentage.

## Testing

Tests are located in `test_tip_calculator.py` and can be run using pytest: `pytest test_tip_calculator.py`

Ensure you have pytest installed before running the tests.
